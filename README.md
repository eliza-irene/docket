#General Assembly | WDI: Project 2

##Overview

**docket** is for anyone who needs help finding ways to maximize their free-time, and desires a more enriching life the docket is a web application that suggests activities of interest based on a user’s available free-time.  Unlike other event finding websites, 
our product combines events and other activities from all corners of the web and suggests them to users based on their interests and schedule.

docket is being developed for a project for the September 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly as a week-long sprint to model the Agile development process.

##User Story Examples

As a user</br>
When I arrive on the site</br>
I want to sign</br>
or be able to create a new account.</br>


As a user </br>
When I’m signed in </br>
I want to see my profile/dashboard</br>
That shows my calendar by month </br>
And gives me a button to schedule new free-time</br>
And gives me the option to search all events with an optional new location parameter.</br>


As a user</br>
When I click on a day to add free-time</br>
I want to be redirected to a new view</br>
That allows me to add the details of my free-time</br>
And save it as a block on my calendar.</br>


As a user </br>
When I add an event</br>
I want to see that the event appears in my calendar.</br>


As a user</br>
When I click on an event</br>
I want to see a pop-up with details of the event</br>
That contains time, place, venue url, and an image</br>
And allows me to get more info through the venue url.</br>
